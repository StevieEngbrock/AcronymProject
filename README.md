# The Acronym Project
A project of acronyms  and bacronyms that I'm making for real english words.

## The Main Idea

Write acronyms for words using word lists.

## Word Lists being used

1. The New General Service Word List
   
2. A word list I made using keyword</br>
   extraction and the books from</br>
   Project Gutenberg

3. Other word list I discover or make

## Questions

1.
   ### Question
   
   Are the words always real words that</br>
   are in the dictionary?
  
   ### Answer

    Many of them will be, but I may make up some words</br>
    just for fun and I intend to do acronyms for all 676</br>
    combinations of two letters.</br>

    We will sort of have to see what happens, but as of
    now (Feburary 17th, 2025) that is the plan.

2.
   ### Question

    Can I use your acronyms as part of training data
    for an AI or language model?
  
   ### Answer

    Sure, go for it!

 3. ### Question
   
    What kind of acronyms are you writing for these words?
    
    ### Answer

    Some are nonsensical and fun, and don't relate to the</br>
    literal meaning of the word. Other acronyms will be</br>
    more serious and relate to the literal meaning of the word.

 4. ### Question
   
    How many acronyms have you written?
    
    ### Answer

    As of today (Feburary 17th, 2025) there are 1030 acronyms
    in the project.

5. ### Question
   
    Why are you doing this ?
    
    ### Answer

    Just because I can, and because it's fun, and because I love writing.

6. ### Question
   
    How many acronyms do you plan to do?
    
    ### Answer

    It's like going to be a a long term project that happens over many years.</br>
    I most likely will never be done, but considering that I already have</br>
    over a thousand, it will likely be several thousand that will be made.</br>
    I hope to be doing this project for the rest of my life</br>

7. ### Question
   
    If you die, can I continue your project?
    
    ### Answer

    Absolutely! I would be delighted to know that my acronym collection</br>
    will continue being enlarged if I should somehow die.</br>

8. ### Question
   
    What file format do your acronyms use?
    
    ### Answer

    At the moment they simply use a python dictionary,</br>
    but you could easily turn them into JSON if you like.</br>

9. ### Question
   
    Will you ever make your acronyms available as a database?
    
    ### Answer
    
    Probably not, because I don't really want to have to maintain</br>
    the main acronym file and a database too.</br>

    You are more than welcome to convert them to a database.

10. ### Question
   
    Can I put your acronym collection on my website?
    
    ### Answer

    Absolutely! I would love to let you put my acronyms on</br>
    your website.</br>

    If you want to do this I would appreciate you let me know</br>
    and tell me what website you are putting them on.</br>

11. ### Question
   
    Can I make a derivitive collective of your acronyms?</br>
    
    ### Answer

    Sure, I'd be glad to let you use your creativity and build something</br>
    new from my acronyms. Pretty much all creativity is about combining or</br>
    modifying or combining existing things to make something new.

    Please let me know if you should decide to make a derivitive copy of my
    acronyms.


12. ### Question
   
    Are your acronyms politically correct, inclusive, and sensitive to various groups?</br>
    
    ### Answer

    I haven't really gone out of my way to make my acronyms politically correct.</br>
    I think doing so could potentially constrain the creativity in my acronyms.</br>

    I can't please everyone, and if you should happen to want a politically correct</br>
    version of my acronyms or happen to believe that they should be politically correct</br>
    you are more than welcome to make your own politically correct version.

    But please let me know if you are going to do so.
    
13. ### Question
   
    Can I make your acronyms into a commercial work and sell them ?</br>
    
    ### Answer

    I would prefer that you didn't, but details and context matter.</br>
    I don't really like the idea of someone else making money off</br>
    of something that I am putting so much personal time, and effort into</br>
    into making.

    Someone using my acronyms in a commercial work could also potentially</br>
    complicate my intention for everyone to be able to enjoy them for free</br>

     That being said, if you are willing to make a significant effort at</br>
     modifying them, to where they are something new than we can talk about</br>
     it.

     If you would like to talk about including my acronyms in a commercial</br>
     work please let me know.
